//WriteacompleteJavaprogramthatreads20valuesoftypedoublefromthe keyboard into an array. 
//Display the last (20th) number read. Then display the numbers in the array and 
//how much each number differs from the 20th number read. For example, 
//if the last value typed by the user is 5.0, 
//the difference between the array element 2.0 and 5.0 is âˆ’3.0. 
//If an array element is 7.0, the difference is 2.0. 
//Assume that the user enters 20 numbers, 
//one per line, at the keyboard. You need not give elaborate instructions to the user.
